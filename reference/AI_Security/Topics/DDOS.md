an Enhanced Mitigation Mechanism is proposed to address these shortcomings using OpenFlow and statistical techniques, 
i.e. Hellinger Distance and Entropy. 
The experiments clearly depicted that EMM is able to detect and mitigate EDoS attacks with high accuracy 
and it is effective in terms of resource utilization compared to existing mitigation techniques. 
Thus, can be deployed in the cloud environment without the need for additional resource requirements.
